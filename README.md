# Better Commit Messages

## Overview

Better Commit Messages is a Visual Studio Code extension that automates the generation of commit messages using OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model. By analyzing Git diffs, this extension provides descriptive and meaningful commit messages to help you maintain a clear and informative commit history. GPT-4o-mini is significantly more advanced than GPT-3-turbo and is about four times cheaper, offering improved performance at a reduced cost.

## Features

- **Automated Commit Message Generation**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model to create commit messages based on the changes in your Git repository.
- **VSCode Integration**:
  - **Status Bar Button**: Includes a button in the status bar at the bottom left, styled with a Git commit icon and a message icon, to generate commit messages with a single click.
  - **Command Palette**: You can also generate commit messages by running the command from the command palette.
- **Clipboard Integration**: The generated commit message is automatically copied to your clipboard for easy pasting.
- **Cost-Effective**: Leverages GPT-4o-mini, providing superior performance compared to GPT-3-turbo at a fraction of the cost.
- **API Key Configuration**: Requires your OpenAI API key to be set in an environment variable.
